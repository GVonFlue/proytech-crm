/* ============================================================================
   A fact has one definition.

   txGross was defined identically in three views. closedOn existed twice, once
   as an exported function and once as a local variable that skipped the
   normalisation. They agreed — the three txGross bodies hashed the same — but
   nothing made them agree, and the comment on one copy records a bug that had
   to be fixed in three files at once:

     "Dragging a card into the Closed column closes the deal WITHOUT writing a
      snapshot, and reading the snapshot alone reported those as $0 of GCI."

   Fix that in two of three and the Dashboard and the Huddle disagree about GCI
   with nothing failing. This is the check that stops the third copy coming back.

   It reads what lib/txn.js exports and asserts no screen defines the same name
   itself — so the list maintains itself: add an export there and it is guarded
   from that moment, with nothing to remember.

   Pure node — reads source, mounts nothing.
