-- ProyTech CRM — whole-database RLS audit
--
-- Paste this into the Supabase SQL Editor and run it. It changes NOTHING. It
-- reads every policy on every table in `public` and tells you which tables are
-- open, by name.
--
-- Run it after any migration, before any release, and on every customer install
-- before handing it over.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--
-- Twice in one day this database was found wide open by a check that had
-- always passed.
--
--   23 Aug 2026, eight content tables: RLS on, one policy each, expression
--   `true`. Every authenticated session had full read/write/delete on pricing,
--   unpublished marketing and the AI spend ledger.
--
--   23 Aug 2026, `leads`: FIVE CORRECT POLICIES plus one leftover called
--   `leads_all_authenticated` with `using = true` and `with check = true`.
--   Permissive policies are OR'd, so the leftover won and every authenticated
--   session could read and write every lead in the business.
--
-- The second one is the important one, and it is why "read the expression" is
-- not a strong enough rule on its own.
--
--   Counting policies on `leads` returned SIX. Reading the five correct ones —
--   which is what a careful person does, because they are the ones with
--   sensible names — returned five correct answers. The table was still open.
--
--   PERMISSIVE POLICIES ARE GRANTS, AND THEY OR TOGETHER. The WEAKEST policy
--   on a table decides what that table allows. Nothing else about the table
--   matters. Five perfect policies plus one `true` is a table with no security
--   at all, and it looks healthier than a table with one policy.
--
-- So the rule is: read EVERY policy on the table, and confirm that NONE of them
-- is permissive-and-true. That is what this file does, for every table, without
-- anyone having to remember which tables matter.

-- 3. WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE
--
-- It proves no table is trivially open. It does NOT prove any policy is
-- CORRECT — an expression can be non-`true` and still wrong, e.g. one that
-- checks the wrong column or the wrong role. That is what VERIFY-RLS.md is
-- for: real logins, real sentinel rows, and a measured before/after.
--
-- Nor does it say anything about the api/ routes, which use
-- SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY and bypass RLS by design. Those are guarded by
-- guard({requireOwner}) and audited in API-AUDIT.md. RLS governs the browser,
-- which is the only thing it can govern.
