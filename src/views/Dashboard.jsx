/* ============================================================================
   Dashboard.jsx — the realtor dashboard (brief §10).

   Two things make this view different from every other CRM dashboard:

   1. CRITICAL DATES ARE THE TOP SECTION. Not production, not a leaderboard.
      A realtor loses a deal by missing an inspection objection deadline, never
      by not knowing their GCI, so the daily driver is pinned first by default.

   2. THE LAYOUT IS DATA. `settings.dashOrder` / `settings.dashHidden` decide
      which sections render and in what order. The team leader arranges it once
      behind the Rearrange button and every agent inherits that layout, minus
      the leader-only sections. Nothing here is hard-coded except the fallback
      order in DASH_SECTIONS.

   Privacy is the database's job (see docs/VIEW-CONTRACT.md) — `ctx.contacts`
   and `ctx.transactions` are already scoped to what this user may see. The one
   thing this view does check is `ctx.isLeader`, and only for layout: whether to
   offer the Rearrange button, and whether the team scorecard / all-agent cap
   bars exist at all.

   All date arithmetic goes through lib/dates. All commission arithmetic goes
   through lib/commission. No `new Date()` in this file.
